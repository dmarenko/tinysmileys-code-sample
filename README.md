# tinysmileys-code-sample
Some of the source-code for the client and texture packer for TinySmileys (omitting server for security reasons)

[https://tinysmileys.com](https://tinysmileys.com) - (currently only for PC; mobile support is work-in-progress)

(PascalCase naming convention is used throughout the source-code because of some intricacies related to [TSCC](https://github.com/theseanl/tscc) / [Google's Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler), which I used for the production build.)
